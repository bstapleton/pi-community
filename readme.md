This project is my attempt at playing around with various technologies that I want to learn. Stuff that I'll be using:

* Laravel 8.x
* Neo4j 3.x
* SASS

You'll notice a lot of random junk in the app for unused models. There is method in this madness. I have a good idea of the sort of app I want to build, but shifting from years of SQL to NoSQL is (as I'm sure many people can appreciate) a bit of a mindf**k. So, with this in mind, I shifted focus towards building a little CMS first.

Not that I expect anyone to read this...
